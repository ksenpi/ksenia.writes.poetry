Sooner or later,
Everyone says they’ll be different
Everyone says they’ll be bold
Everyone says they’ll grow
To fit another mold

And I want to believe you when you say
That I won’t have to repeat their mistakes
But I see the stars in their eyes and the stars in their hearts

---
The love they have for me is overarching, overbearing
Boundless, faultless, timeless.

I hear shouting again
And I press myself into the soft folds of my blanket
I feel like a child again

I want my love to be different
I want my love to be bold
I want my love to grow
To fit another mold

---
I don’t want my love to fight about roadtrips or money
Or what time one must go to bed
I want my love to be a shoulder on which,
Even after thirty years,
I can rest my weary head.

I want my love to be my friend
Even when the world assuredly does not
I want my love to be different
To go against what I’ve been taught.
