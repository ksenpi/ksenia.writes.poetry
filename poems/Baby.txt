Baby baby baby
I wish I had written a poem for you
Five years ago

But we were too busy changing diapers,
Feeding you,
Holding you,
Loving you.

Now you're five and already I forget
The sleepless nights
I miss the holding, the stillness of just you and I

---
Don't grow up baby,
But don't listen to your mom

Listen to your heart
The voice that tells you where to go -- and grow --
Grow into a tall tree or a small seed
Grow into all of your dreams
Lay them down when you need

Lay them down by the river
And swim so free
And I'll hope some days the current
Will carry you back to me.
