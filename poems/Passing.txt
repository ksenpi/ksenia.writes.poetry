The months and days that pass
Beyond your last
I wonder if it all was real
Or like a nightmare
Finally past.

Or yet,
A dream
Of two and four

---
Your tender eyes
Your tender hands
Not built to last
But knit together fearfully
Loved so deeply
And still so deeply.

You are forever in my heart,
Love mama
