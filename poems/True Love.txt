God is real
I know this now
He was with me my first sunrise
And will be till my last sundown

The love of any other comes and goes
Just as a tree’s leaves fall away
But His love will stay. 

---
Behind a clear blue sky
Or on a grey forgotten day
His love will stay.

In the midst of my pain
In the midst of my sorrow
In the midst of my joy overlayed -
His love, will stay.
