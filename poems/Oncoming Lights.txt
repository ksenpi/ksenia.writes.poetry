The impenetrable highway we pass
Through town and town again we’ll be
In 100 Mile by midnight, I hope

Leaving behind one side of our family and
Making our way to the other, I’m shocked
To find that we spend so many of the hours

---
In laughter, I pee in my seat a little bit
More than once. Me and you,
In the in-between, that’s what it’s about
