This is the kind of place that can only be felt
Seven steps away from the hospital.
How is it possible to hear the rustling of leaves
In the midst of the city?
In the midst of my sorrow and fear.
It is you, God, who gives me this place
And this peace which surpasses
All understanding:

And now God, I submit to your will
To your perfect plans
To your beautiful chaos

Knowing

That one day I will meet you at the gates of Heaven and you will say,

I love you Ksenia
I loved your kids
I loved Nolan

And now you may greet them all,
Home at last.
