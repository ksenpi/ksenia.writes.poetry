The efflorescence of forgotten Spring
Walking the length of a traffic packed
Garden, gabardine in hand
I can hear the cars talk just beyond
The gentian tangled gate

---
Hopscotch in full bloom, there’s not a lot of room
For children under the city.
Ionosphere in a rocking chair, finally
It’s warm. The last laundromat hums
On real-estate mafioso coins.
