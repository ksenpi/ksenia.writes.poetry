The week I fell in love
My hair went from brown to gold
Cheeks rosying by the second,
I dared myself to be bold

The week I fell in love
Alarm clocks were thrown away
I dreamt of flowers every night
And woke early to the sound of bells
Ringing in the day

---
The week I fell in love
I ate nothing
And cried three times
Shedding tears as tribute
To every Jane Austen love story ever told
They too, were bold

The week I fell in love
I smiled in roses
Slept less, drank coffee in larger doses
Learned about his crannies and nooks
---
Read comic books
I ate Indian food
I saw that God's plans are good

The week I fell in love
Not everything fell into place
I still had homework to do, ritual co-worker dates

Still, I slowed my pace
And gently, oh-so-gently
Everything but you fell away.
