Oh God of love, of might
I awoke this morning in a state of delight
Your words were on my lips, your goodness filled my heart
But from that place I was doomed to depart

I let myself stray into anxiety and fear
I let myself forget that you are always near

---
And yet, tonight, you forgive even this
My countless doubts and my self-proclaimed bliss

You picked up my worries, my imperfections too
And held them up to me, so I could see what’s true
In the palm of your hand they all looked so small
For you to overcome them was nothing at all.
