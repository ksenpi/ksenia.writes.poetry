There’s little people
On Main Mall walking toward
Beatty, their first time.

In second grade the greatest stress in my day was remembering to ask mum to sign my field trip slip. Ice cream was altogether spectacular and altogether not real in the way it is now, nutrients and preservatives and powdered whey.

Chicken pox: dots on
My face. They almost didn’t
Let me on the plane

---
I kept my CD player close and my two CDs closer, I still know all those ABBA and Beatle’s hits by heart, Penny Lane never really goes away. Mo kissed me on the face, I really had liked him before that day. Two hockey players came to school and told us drugs were bad and a TV crew came! And I was on the nightly news that night.

On Main Mall, filing
Into Beatty, their first time
Single file, please.
